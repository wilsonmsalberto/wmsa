    <p>
      I've been a Front End developer since 2011 and during that time had the opportunity to work with many different
      types of tech within many different areas of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      After working in advertising, education, consultancy and fashion, I've enjoyed all different kinds of challenges
      these areas have thrown at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time, I've also had the pleasure to take a swing at leadership by becoming an Engineering Lead for a
      couple of years, definitely a career I'm looking forward to pursue.
    </p>
    <p>I had the opportunity to meet, learn and mentor some great people and work in many different areas.</p>
    <p>If you do have any questions, get in touch. I'd love to talk to you about it.</p>
